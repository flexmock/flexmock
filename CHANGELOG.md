## Release 0.11.0

### Added

- Add Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 support.
- Add type annotations.

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Flexmock needs to be imported explicitly using `from flexmock import flexmock`.
  The hack that allowed flexmock to be imported directly using `import flexmock` did not work well with static analysis tools.
- Many error messages have been improved.
- Undocumented methods `Expectation.reset`, `Expectation.verify`, and `Expectation.match_args` that were unintentionally left public are now private methods.
- Undocumented attributes in `Mock` and `Expectation` are now private. These attributes were never meant to be accessed directly.

### Removed

- Drop Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 support.
- Drop Pytest 4.x support.
- Remove unittest2 and nose integrations. unittest2 and nose are not maintained anymore.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed support for calling `once`, `twice`, `never`, and `mock` methods
  without parentheses. This allows code completion and static analysis to work with these methods.

### Fixed

- Fix `should_call` is broken if called on a fake object.
- Fix `and_raise` allows invalid arguments for an exception.

### Infrastructure

- Run linters and tests using Github Actions.
- Add coverage reporting using Codecov.

### Documentation

- Add contribution documentation.
- Use Mkdocs instead of Sphinx to build the documentation.

- Fix previous pytest `--durations` fix not working.

## Release 0.10.6

### Fixed

- Fix new_instances method not working with Python 2.7.
- Fix multiple expectations for the same classmethod are not matched.

## Release 0.10.5

### Added

- Improve error message on unmatched method signature expectation.

### Fixed

## Release 0.10.4

### Added

### Removed

### Fixed

- Don't hide exception when flexmock is used as context manager.
- Fix expectation reset for static methods on PyPy 2.
- Ensure original exception is not suppressed in pytest hook.
